# Object-Detection-in-Python-Using-YOLO-algorithm
YOLO is a real-time object identification Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The program separates the image into areas and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region using a single neural network. The projected probabilities are used to weigh the bounding boxes.
